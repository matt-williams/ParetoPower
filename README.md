# ParetoPower

Share sustainably-generated power with your neighbors!

This is a hack for the Worldpay Payments & IoT Hackathon.  It consists of an ESP8266/Arduino-based server that measures and distributes sustainably-generated power, and an Android-based client to intelligently decide when it is best to charge (taking into account its battery level and the current cost of energy).
